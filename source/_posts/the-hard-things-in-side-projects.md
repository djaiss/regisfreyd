description: Focusing on what's really important is really hard.

I've been working on the rewrite of Monica ([codename Chandler](https://github.com/monicahq/chandler)) for over a year now. In many aspects, Chandler has more robust features than Monica. It also misses a few importants concepts, like conversations, gift management or an API.

And more than anything else, it misses a way to charge customers, despite the fact that we've written our [own open source customer portal](https://github.com/monicahq/customers).

However, implementing the communication with the customer portal, making it work, disabling features when the customer doesn't have the right plan, etc... are really boring and unexciting tasks. So I prefer to focus on new stuff. Exciting stuff. Stuff that makes me learn something. Stuff that does not drive us towards the goal of working full time of the actual project.

Because that's really the consequence. Working on exciting stuff drives us away from shipping stuff to actual users. We can't release the new version if we can't charge for it. So we wait, implement new and exciting features that will blow users' minds. But those users still don't see this work.

The hard things with side projects is to force yourself to do unsexy stuff. I hope I will have the strength to bring the unsexy back in February.
