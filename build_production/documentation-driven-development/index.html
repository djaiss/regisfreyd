    <p>Documentation is hard and feels unrewarding. Therefore, itâ€™s the last thing you write. When you start your project, you have a high level of motivation and this is how your development cycle looks like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write feature</li>
<li>Write tests</li>
<li>Push features to production</li>
<li>Write documentation</li>
<li>Publish documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>After a few months, your motivation starts to decrease and your development cycle looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write feature</li>
<li>Write tests</li>
<li>Push features to production</li>
<li>Write documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>Time passes. Your development cycle now looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write feature</li>
<li>Write tests</li>
<li>Push features to production</li>
</ul>

<h2>The many benefits of a great documentation</h2>

<p>Documentation is hard to write and hard to maintain. Even more at the end of the feature cycle, when youâ€™ve forgotten all the edge cases you wrote.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s sad, because there are actually many benefits of having a great documentation, especially with side projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>It greatly helps the adoption of your project by other developers, as almost no one will work on your tool if you don't provide some kind of documentation.</li>
<li>Itâ€™s free marketing. Documentation contains all the keywords necessary for your SEO, and you wonâ€™t have to write those shitty blog posts that most internet gurus tell you to write and no one wants to read.</li>
<li>Itâ€™s really useful for your users, as most of them are not actually you, therefore needing guidance on how to use your tool.</li>
<li>It reduces the number of customer support tickets you will have to answer to.</li>
</ul>

<p>A complete, well-written documentation is always the sign of a great product. Itâ€™s easily the most powerful tool you have at your disposal if you know nothing about marketing and still want to gain some traction. READMEs are also a very powerful marketing tool that I should write about in the future.</p>

<h2>Change how you write softwares</h2>

<p>I suggest to completely change how you write softwares.</p>

<p>Start with the documentation. That means: do not write a single line of code without having completely documented the feature you are about to write.</p>

<p>Then, write the code that supports this documentation, and write tests that match this code. Or write tests then the code if you are fan of TDD â€” it doesnâ€™t really matter.</p>

<p>Sometimes, tests will show you that you missed something in your documentation. Update it accordingly.</p>

<p>Then push both the code and the documentation to production.</p>

<p>Later on, if you need to modify the feature, start by updating your documentation. Then update your code. Always start with the documentation.</p>

<p>Ideally, you would have a rule in your CI that prevent you from committing a feature without the associated documentation. I don't know how to do it programmatically, but you can simply have a checklist in your pull request template that lets you achieve this goal.</p>

<h2>Final note</h2>

<p>I don't like methodologies in general. Donâ€™t waste time with TDD, BDD and other methodologies that seem to be designed to slow down side projects.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s really important is a software</p>

<ul>
<li>That works,</li>
<li>That is really fast,</li>
<li>That has a great documentation so both developers and users will know how to use it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Point 1 is covered by having tests. Write tests, always, but not too many.</p>

<p>Point 2 comes with experience. Making a software fast is a result of a lot of decisions and should be one of your priority, but you will only know how to it well after a few years of struggling with bad code.</p>

<p>Point 3 comes by forcing you to write documentation before you do anything.</p>

<p>Nothing else matters, really.</p>
